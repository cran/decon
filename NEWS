What's new?

The Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) algorithm has been implemented to the estimation in 
measurement error models. The plot and print functions have been updated.

The package provides a collection of function series of functions to deal with 
nonparametric measurement error problems using the deconvolution kernel methods. The 
functions allow the errors to be either homoscedastic or heteroscedastic. To make 
the deconvolution estimators computationally more efficient in R, we adapt the FFT 
algorithm for density estimation with error-free data to the deconvolution kernel 
estimation. Several bandwidth selection functions are also developed in the package.
